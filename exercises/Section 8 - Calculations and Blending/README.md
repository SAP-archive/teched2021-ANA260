# Section 8 - Calculations and Blending

‚ÑπÔ∏è**Objective:** Use the latest calculations available in SAP Analytics Cloud to expose additional information that 
was not available in your original data model. Understand the potential and workflow of blending models and 
creating calculations in our story.

**Estimated Time:** 25 mins

**Exercise Description:** You have access to shipping information and financial sales data that with some 
common dimensions, including Order Number and Store Name. You need to create various calculated 
dimensions, statistical aggregations, and blended visualizations to understand the effects of shipping times 
and impact of delivery delays on sales revenue.

**Key Features:**
- Create calculated dimensions with string functions to enhance your data
- Understand how to blend data models by linking on common dimensions
- Employ statistical calculations in aggregations of your data
- Integrate calculation input controls to simulate values in your visualizations

‚ö†Ô∏è**Disclaimer**
When completing exercises, some data values in the screenshots may not match what you see on your 
screen. This is because the dynamic time filters that were applied at the time the screenshots were taken is 
different from the current system date.

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to Calculated Dimensions!  
  
Calculated Dimensions are useful when you want to enrich your dimension if your model does not have the needed format. 
 
You can choose to combine existing dimensions to create your own dimensions. There are two calculated dimensions that can be created: 
  
**Calculated Dimension:** Use formulas to create new dimension members 
  
**Measure Based Dimension:** Use ranges within an existing measure to determine how to group 
dimension members together 

![8-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141001216-206f391e-838f-4990-bfa6-a4c54f412bde.png)

üö©As we want to identify the stores that are studios, we will use the regular calculated dimension.

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to String Functions in the Calculation Editor! There are a variety of different String Functions that can be used to transform the Dimension values to a specific use case. 
  
**FINDINDEX:** Search for a substring and return its 0 based index 
**ENDSWITH:** Returns True if given string ends with user given substring 
**TRIM:** Removes unwanted leading and trailing spaces 
**REPLACE:** Replace characters in a string with a specified replacement 
**SPLIT:** Returns substring from a string using a specified divider 
**UPPERCASE/LOWERCASE:** Convert a string to all Lower or all Upper case 
**CONCAT:** Combine two strings together 
**LEFT/RIGHT:** Returns the specified number of characters from the beginning or end of a string 
  
Let us use RIGHT function to categorize Stores by if they are a Studio. 

21. Scroll till **RIGHT** is **Visible**

22. Click **RIGHT**

üö©Up until this point, we have been working with visualizations built from measures and dimensions spanning a single model. Now, we can improve the value of our analysis through Blending to combine data sources. We can accomplish this by linking dimensions across models so we can compare and analyze the relationship between measures and dimensions across multiple models

‚ÑπÔ∏èIf you are missing the icon for Link Dimensions in your toolbar, click on 
... under More to surface this option. 

39. Click **Link Dimensions**

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to Link Dimensions! 
  
Link Dimensions allow you to create blended visualizations that display data from multiple models. It also allows you to create filters that simultaneously update all visualization that include linked data regardless of the model.  
  
By default, the ID attribute is used to match members between the linked dimensions. However, for non-hierarchy dimensions it is possible to change the description that is used for linking. 

We can utilize Linked Dimensions in our data by linking across the Finance and Shipping models by connecting dimensions that are identical across our two models. 

![8-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/140554043-d42dfb93-1be3-4934-bca9-4d47c2ac8b51.png)

üö©Let us link the Order Number and Store dimensions between our two models. Both these dimensions are identical across our models and have independent members that we can gather insights from. By linking on Store and Order Number we can look at analyses that target Store entities or individual orders. 

40. Scroll and Click **Order Number**

üö©It is important to specify the Dimension Attribute we are linking across. Order Number in our models is common on the Dimension ID whereas Store is common on the Dimension Description (the store name). Let us make sure that Order Number is linked by IDs between the models and Store is linked by Description or Store Names between the models.
