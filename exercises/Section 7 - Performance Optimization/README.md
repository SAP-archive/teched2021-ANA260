# Section 7 - Performance Optimization

‚ÑπÔ∏è**Objective:** Use Natural Language Search (Search to Insight) to translate your questions into visualizations 
and understand how to run a Smart Discovery within SAP Analytics Cloud. Develop an understanding and 
purpose of the various pages that are created by Smart Discovery.

**Estimated Time:** 15 mins

**Exercise Description:** After hearing back from your colleagues about the dashboard you shared, you have 
a few quick questions regarding the company‚Äôs financial. You can quickly find answers for your questions via 
Search to Insight, leveraging SAC‚Äôs natural language processing capabilities. Once you try Search to Insight 
for yourself, you can tell your colleagues all about it and they will no longer need to come to you with their 
questions about data. 

Once SAP Analytics Cloud found the answer to your questions you want to use other smart features such 
smart insight and time series forecast to enhance the result. Finally, you want to use Smart Discovery to 
have SAP Analytics Cloud investigate Gross Margin at BestRun and automatically built a story for you.

**Key Features:**
- Use Search to Insight to find answers for your questions with natural language
- Have SAP Analytics Cloud investigate one of the measures and build a dashboard for you with Smart Discovery
- Understand how Smart Insights can help you explain more of your data

üö©**Notice!** You no longer have the optimization tip. Even though you added another chart and removed the table, you no longer have the performance tip. This is because the table was a heavier and more complex widget than a chart. Hence, it was impacting the performance of your story.

üí°As you expand the new Input Control, you see there is a new Performance Tip.

üí°Now if you try add another page to the story, you will see a new Optimization Tip. It is letting you know that you now already have a lot of pages in the story and it may impact the story's performance if you add an additional page.

‚ÑπÔ∏èIn Optimized View Mode, a new feature "Ghost Loading Indicator" is added. 
 
Dashboards now display an animated ghost widget, while data from the server is retrieved. It provides the story viewer an early insight to the type of visualization that is rendering and makes it easier to tell which objects are loading especially when they are small.
