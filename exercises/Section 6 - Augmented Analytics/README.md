‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to Smart Discocery!
 
Smart Discovery offers you a viable way to use automated machine learning on top of your BI data, without losing precious analysis time on data preparation. Simply decide the business question you want to ask your data and let Smart Discovery analyze it for you, by running a machine learning algorithm. You can then explore the generated results to gain insights into your data.

![6-62](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138958435-911a9be5-429c-44d0-92fe-ca1934a1d9d8.png)

‚ÑπÔ∏èSmart Discovery helps you, as a business analyst, to understand the process that it‚Äôs using to analyze your data for you. It helps you to specify the right question, and quickly understand the generated results. You can refine the question by modifying the target or entity, filtering the dataset or excluding variables for the analysis. The Target is the measure or dimension you would like to know more about like Revenue or Customer Churn. The Entity defines the dimension or dimensions that describe the object in the data you would like to know more about, for instance customer or product. The entity describes the key that identifies each instance of that object. Smart Discovery will aggregate the data to the level described by the entity

‚ö†Ô∏èSmart Discovery automatically prepares the data for the business question, analyzes the data and generates content for you. The process automatically builds a predictive model to predict the target. The insights provided on the Key Influencers, Unexpected Values and Simulation pages are based on this model.
 
It is important to note that the analysis is performed on a snapshot of the data at the time Smart Discovery is run and that the analysis is not updated automatically in response to updates to the data. All the content generated by Smart Discovery is dynamic and changes based on the underlying data.

‚ÑπÔ∏èSmart Discovery Creates up to Four Pages: 
1.	Overview: The overview page provides visualizations to summarize the results for your target dimension or measure in relation to your entity
2.	Key Influencers:The Key Influencers page is generated based on the predictive model. The Key Influencers page lists (ranked from highest to lowest) up to 10 dimensions and measures that significantly impact the target. 
3.	Unexpected Values: contains a table with the records that have been identified by the underlying machine learning model as unexpected. The table shows the actual and the predicted values along with the other corresponding dimensions.  
4.	Simulation: it contains a listing of the key influencers and their corresponding values. You can simulate an impact by selecting values for each key influencer. The impact of the value is reflected on the chart.

üö©Here we can see that the tool has identified 10 things that influence Gross Margin the most. There is an informative summary on the right and you can scroll down to see more information charted for the top 3 key influencers. Region has the greatest influence on Gross Margin.

‚ÑπÔ∏èAs region has the strongest influence it is preselected. The average Gross Margin for stores by region and the distribution of stores by region are shown to provide an intuitive view of how region impacts gross margin at the store level. The input control allow the suer to switch between influencers.

‚ÑπÔ∏èThe unexpected values are stores in our data where  the values for gross margin predicted by the predictive model differs significantly form the actual value in the data. These values can be interesting as these stores re different to the pattern detected in the overall dataset. This might indicate an issue with the data or store that have unusual behaviour.

Looks like we only have a few unexpected values. Let's move to the simulation page
