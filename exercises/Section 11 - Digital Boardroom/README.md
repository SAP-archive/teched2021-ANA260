üö©With the help of other colleges, we've created several dashboards that help us analyze the performance of BestRun. However, as these dashboards are currently consumed as individual stories, we want to create a Digital Boardroom that can be used by the executives to analyze the performance of the various departments.

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to the **Digital Boardroom!**
 
The Digital Boardroom is a place to design a real-time, interactive boardroom presentation. 
-	**Agenda:** it allows you to set various meeting talking points and associate pages from different stories. 
-	**Dashboard:** it's a more dynamic presentation style in comparison to Agendas. It allows you to present in freeform and jump from topic to topic without having to complete the agenda before moving on. 

üö©Based on the previous executive meetings, we know that the board members tend to prefer more dynamic presentations instead of fixed agenda. Hence, let‚Äôs create a Dashboard.
