[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-ANA260)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-ANA260/)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2021 session called ANA260 - Experience Interactive Storytelling for Information Workers.

## Overview

This session consists of a series of exercises to introduce you to the most innovative features in SAP Analytics Cloud. You will learn how to create your first story, use the newest data visualization features, harness smart analytics to get the most from your data, and build impactful stories.

We've also included additional in-depth content for expereinced users which will teach best practices and overview how to use powerful SAC features to create calculations, blend data, build versatile geo visualizations, manipulate time dimensions, and showcase your work in Digital Boardroom.

The script and exercises are built to accomodate new users as well as experienced users. New users are recommended to focus on sections one to seven, which will take approximately two hours, and more advanced users should try the deep dives if they'd like to learn more about complex topics. 

## Instructions to Log onto Tenant

We will be using a provided SAP Analytics Cloud tenant for these exercises.

Tenant URL: [https://ana161.eu10.hcs.cloud.sap/](https://ana161.eu10.hcs.cloud.sap/)

Users: [User List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0J6pmLGLFT86OcXr49WC1sNa1YKEDEM02zglxa5TlE/edit?usp=sharing)

Our exercises build on the previous exercise for a holistic learning experience. For newer users, it is recommended to follow the exercises in order. You may find each completed exercise as a story that can be duplicated from the Public/TechEd folder on the tenant. This allows you to personalize your session experience by moving to the section most interesting to you.
