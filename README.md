## Overview

We've also included additional in-depth content for expereinced users which will teach best practices and overview how to use powerful SAC features to create calculations, blend data, build versatile geo visualizations, manipulate time dimensions, and showcase your work in Digital Boardroom.

## Instructions to Log onto Tenant

We will be using a provided SAP Analytics Cloud tenant for these exercises.

Tenant URL: https://ana161.eu10.hcs.cloud.sap/ (to be updated)

Users: User List (to be updated)

Our exercises build on the previous exercise for a holistic learning experience. For newer users, it is recommended to follow the exercises in order. You may find each completed exercise as a story that can be duplicated from the Public/TechEd folder on the tenant. This allows you to personalize your session experience by moving to the section most interesting to you.
